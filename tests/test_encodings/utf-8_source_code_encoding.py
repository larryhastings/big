# This file serves a dual purpose in the test suite!
# It both uses an ASCII "source code encoding" line,
# which lets us test decoding those lines.
#
# Also, when run it generates two more Python scripts,
# using unfamiliar encodings, both with BOMs:
#     * "gb18030_bom.py" uses the "gb18030" encoding.
#       This is an encoding defined by the PRC.
#     * "utf-1_bom.py" uses the "UTF-1" encoding,
#       an obsolete encoding replaced by the far
#       superior UTF-8.
#
# Note that Python doesn't support UTF-1!
# This is useful to test the "we don't support this encoding" logic.
# 100% coverage without pragma nocover, here we come!
